# Journal Club – Paper & Speaker Tracking

Welcome to the Journal Club repository!  
We use this space to track suggested papers, proposed speakers, voting, and upcoming sessions.

This repo complements our Google Form submission system.  
All suggestions submitted through the form are added here as GitHub Issues so the group can discuss and vote on them transparently.

## How to Suggest Papers or Speakers

### **Step 1 — Submit via Google Form**
Use the form to propose:
- Papers you'd like the group to read  
- Speakers you'd like to invite  
- Any ideas for journal club improvements  

(Form link will be added here once available.)

### **Step 2 — View Suggestions on GitHub**
All submissions appear as **Issues**:

- **Paper Suggestions** → labeled `paper`  
- **Speaker Suggestions** → labeled `speaker`

You can:
- **Vote** for papers or speakers you want to prioritize  
- Add comments or questions  
- Follow updates on upcoming sessions
