# Journal Club – Paper & Speaker Tracking

Welcome to The Learning Curve journal club repository!  
We use this space to track suggested papers, proposed speakers, voting, and upcoming sessions.

This repo complements our Google Form submission system.  
All suggestions submitted through the form are added here as GitHub Issues so the group can discuss and vote on them transparently.
